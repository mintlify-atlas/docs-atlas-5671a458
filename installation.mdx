description: Install ClawControl on Linux, macOS, or Windows
---

ClawControl requires the Bun runtime. The one-liner install scripts handle this automatically, or you can install Bun manually if using a package manager.

## One-liner install (recommended)

The install scripts automatically detect your platform, install Bun if needed, and set up ClawControl globally.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipenywis/clawcontrol/main/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipenywis/clawcontrol/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The install scripts will:
- Check for Bun and install it if missing
- Install ClawControl globally
- Add the `clawcontrol` command to your PATH
</Note>

## Package managers

You can also install ClawControl using npm, pnpm, or Bun directly. **Note:** You must install Bun manually first, as these package managers only install ClawControl itself.

### Install Bun first

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Then install ClawControl

<CodeGroup>

```bash Bun
bun add -g clawcontrol
```

```bash npm
npm install -g clawcontrol
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g clawcontrol
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
ClawControl requires the Bun runtime to execute. If you install via npm or pnpm without Bun, the CLI will not work. Always install Bun first when using package managers.
</Warning>

## System requirements

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bun runtime">
    Required for running the ClawControl CLI. The install scripts handle this automatically, or install from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Node.js 20+">
    Only required if you're developing or building ClawControl from source. Not needed for regular usage.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Terminal with true color support">
    For the best experience, use a modern terminal:
    - **Recommended**: Ghostty, iTerm2, Kitty, WezTerm
    - **macOS Terminal.app**: Requires macOS 26+ (Tahoe) for full color support
    
    ClawControl will detect terminals without true color support and show a warning banner.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify installation

After installation, verify that ClawControl is available:

```bash
clawcontrol --version
```

<CodeGroup>

```bash Output
clawcontrol v0.2.3
```

```bash Show help
clawcontrol --help
```

```bash Launch TUI
clawcontrol
```

</CodeGroup>

You should see the version number (currently 0.2.3). To launch the interactive TUI, simply run:

```bash
clawcontrol
```

This will open the ClawControl interface with the ASCII logo and command palette:

```
   _____ _                  _____            _             _
  / ____| |                / ____|          | |           | |
 | |    | | __ ___      __| |     ___  _ __ | |_ _ __ ___ | |
 | |    | |/ _` \ \ /\ / /| |    / _ \| '_ \| __| '__/ _ \| |
 | |____| | (_| |\ V  V / | |___| (_) | | | | |_| | | (_) | |
  \_____|_|\__,_| \_/\_/   \_____\___/|_| |_|\__|_|  \___/|_|

Deploy and manage OpenClaw instances with ease

Type a command (e.g., /new)...
```

## Updating ClawControl

To update to the latest version, run the install script again or use your package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash One-liner (Linux/macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipenywis/clawcontrol/main/install.sh | bash
```

```bash Bun
bun update -g clawcontrol
```

```bash npm
npm update -g clawcontrol
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm update -g clawcontrol
```

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command not found: clawcontrol">
    The ClawControl binary is not in your PATH. Try:
    
    1. Close and reopen your terminal
    2. Check if `~/.bun/bin` is in your PATH: `echo $PATH`
    3. Manually add to PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"`
    4. Reinstall using the one-liner script
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bun: command not found">
    Bun is not installed or not in your PATH:
    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```
    
    Then restart your terminal or run: `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Colors look wrong or broken">
    Your terminal may not support true color. ClawControl will show a warning banner if this is detected.
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Switch to a modern terminal (Ghostty, iTerm2, Kitty, WezTerm)
    - On macOS, upgrade to macOS 26+ for Terminal.app true color support
    - On older systems, the CLI will still work but colors may render incorrectly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission denied errors">
    You may need to run with elevated permissions or fix ownership:
    
    ```bash
    # Fix npm global directory ownership
    sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
    
    # Or reinstall without sudo using the one-liner
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipenywis/clawcontrol/main/install.sh | bash
    ```
