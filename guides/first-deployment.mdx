description: 'Step-by-step guide to deploying your first OpenClaw instance'
---

This guide walks you through creating and deploying your first OpenClaw instance using ClawControl.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A cloud provider account (Hetzner Cloud or DigitalOcean)
- An API key from your cloud provider
- An AI provider account (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.)
- A Telegram bot token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Your Telegram user ID for access control

<Tip>
  Use the built-in templates to get started quickly. Templates pre-configure optimal settings for common use cases.
</Tip>

## Creating Your Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch ClawControl">
    Start ClawControl from your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    clawcontrol
    ```
    
    You'll see the main menu with available commands.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the new deployment wizard">
    Type `/new` and press Enter to start creating a deployment.
    
    The wizard will guide you through several steps:
    
    **Step 1: Choose a template**
    
    Select a pre-configured template or start with a blank configuration:
    
    ```
    > Blank configuration
      Hetzner + OpenRouter Kimi K2.5 [built-in]
      DigitalOcean + OpenRouter Kimi K2.5 [built-in]
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      Built-in templates are tested configurations that work well for most users. Choose "Hetzner + OpenRouter Kimi K2.5" for a cost-effective setup.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your deployment">
    Choose a unique name for your deployment:
    
    ```
    Name: my-openclaw-server
    ```
    
    - Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
    - Must be unique across your deployments
    - This name will be used for the VPS hostname
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure cloud provider">
    If you selected a template, the provider is pre-selected. Otherwise, choose your provider:
    
    ```
    > Hetzner Cloud - Recommended - US East
      DigitalOcean - NYC1 - New York
    ```
    
    **Enter your API key:**
    
    - For Hetzner: Get your API token from [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
    - For DigitalOcean: Create a Personal Access Token from [DigitalOcean API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)
    
    The wizard validates your API key before proceeding.
    
    <Tip>
      ClawControl can securely save your API keys for future deployments. Press `Y` when prompted to save.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select server size (DigitalOcean only)">
    If using DigitalOcean, choose your droplet size:
    
    ```
    > s-1vcpu-2gb - 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 50GB SSD - $12/mo
      s-2vcpu-2gb - 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 60GB SSD - $18/mo
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      OpenClaw requires at least 2GB RAM to run reliably. Smaller sizes may cause memory errors.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure AI provider">
    Enter your AI provider details:
    
    **Provider:** Choose your AI service (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.)
    
    **API Key:** Enter your AI provider's API key
    
    **Model:** Specify the model identifier:
    ```
    Anthropic:  claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    OpenAI:     gpt-4o
    OpenRouter: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    Google:     gemini-2.0-flash
    Groq:       llama-3.3-70b-versatile
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Telegram">
    Set up your Telegram bot:
    
    **Bot Token:** Get this from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
    ```
    Format: 123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
    ```
    
    **Allowed User:** Enter your Telegram user ID for access control
    
    <Tip>
      To find your Telegram user ID, message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Tailscale (optional)">
    Choose whether to set up Tailscale for secure gateway access:
    
    ```
    > Skip
      Configure Tailscale
    ```
    
    Tailscale creates a private VPN so only you can access the OpenClaw gateway.
    
    <Tip>
      You can always add Tailscale later by editing your deployment configuration.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm and create">
    Review your configuration and press `Y` to create the deployment:
    
    ```
    Configuration Summary:
    
    Name:         my-openclaw-server
    Provider:     Hetzner Cloud
    Location:     Ashburn, VA (US East)
    Server:       CPX11 (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
    AI Provider:  OpenRouter
    Model:        moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
    Channel:      Telegram
    
    Press Y to confirm, N to go back
    ```
    
    ClawControl creates the deployment configuration and saves it locally.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploying Your Instance

After creating the deployment configuration, you're ready to deploy:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start deployment">
    From the main menu, select your deployment and run:
    
    ```bash
    /deploy
    ```
    
    The deployment process begins automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor progress">
    ClawControl shows real-time progress as it:
    
    ```
    [████████████████░░░░░░░░] 65%
    Current: Installing Node.js
    
    Deployment Log:
    [14:23:45] Starting deployment: my-openclaw-server

    ```
    
    The deployment includes 16 checkpoints:
    
    1. Server created
    2. SSH key uploaded
    3. SSH connected
    4. Swap configured
    5. System updated
    6. NVM installed

    13. Tailscale authenticated (if enabled)
    14. Tailscale configured (if enabled)
    15. Daemon started
    16. Completed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tailscale authentication (if enabled)">
    If you enabled Tailscale, you'll be prompted to authenticate:
    
    ```
    Confirmation Required
    
    Tailscale needs authentication.
    
    Would you like to open your browser to authenticate?
    URL: https://login.tailscale.com/...
    
    Press Y for Yes, N for No
    ```
    
    Press `Y` to open the authentication page in your browser. After authenticating, the deployment continues automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Optional interactive setup">
    Near the end of deployment, you may be prompted:
    
    ```
    Your OpenClaw config has been applied and the daemon is running.
    
    Would you like to also run 'openclaw onboard' interactively
    for additional setup?
    ```
    
    - Press `Y` if you want to configure additional OpenClaw settings
    - Press `N` to skip (your agent is already configured and running)
    
    If you choose `Y`, a terminal window opens with an SSH session.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deployment complete">
    When deployment finishes successfully, you'll see:
    
    ```
    Deployment Successful!
    Your OpenClaw instance is now running.
    
    Connection Details
    Server IP:      159.89.123.45
    Tailscale IP:   100.64.1.23
    Gateway Port:   18789
    
    Next steps:
      /ssh  - Connect to your server
      /logs - View OpenClaw logs
      Gateway: http://100.64.1.23:18789/
    ```
    
    Your OpenClaw instance is now live and ready to use!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test Telegram bot">
    Open Telegram and start a conversation with your bot:
    
    ```
    /start
    ```
    
    Your bot should respond, confirming it's running correctly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the gateway">
    Open the gateway URL in your browser:
    
    ```
    http://YOUR_TAILSCALE_IP:18789/
    ```
    
    Or if Tailscale is not configured:
    ```
    http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:18789/
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      If you're not using Tailscale, your gateway is publicly accessible. Make sure to secure it or enable Tailscale.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check deployment status">
    Back in ClawControl, run:
    
    ```bash
    /status
    ```
    
    Select your deployment to see:
    - Connection status
    - OpenClaw daemon health
    - Recent checkpoints
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails

If deployment fails, ClawControl automatically retries up to 3 times. If it still fails:

1. Check the error message in the deployment log
2. Run `/status` to see which checkpoint failed
3. Run `/deploy` again - it resumes from the last successful checkpoint

### Can't connect to SSH

If SSH connection times out:

1. Wait a few minutes for the server to finish booting
2. Check your cloud provider's firewall settings
3. Verify the server was created in your cloud provider's dashboard

### OpenClaw not responding

If your bot doesn't respond:

1. Run `/logs` to check for errors
2. Run `/ssh` to connect and check the service:
   ```bash
   systemctl status openclaw
   ```
3. Check your Telegram bot token and user ID are correct
