title: 'Destroying Deployments'
description: 'Safely remove OpenClaw deployments and clean up cloud resources'
---

When you're done with a deployment, use the `/destroy` command to properly clean up cloud resources and local configuration.

<Warning>
  Destroying a deployment is permanent and irreversible. All data on the server will be lost.
</Warning>

## What Gets Destroyed

The destroy process removes:

**Cloud Resources:**
- VPS server instance
- Associated SSH keys from cloud provider
- Public IP address
- All data on the server

**Local Files:**
- Deployment configuration (`~/.clawcontrol/deployments/NAME/config.json`)
- Deployment state (`~/.clawcontrol/deployments/NAME/state.json`)
- SSH key pair (`~/.clawcontrol/deployments/NAME/ssh/`)
- Entire deployment directory

**What Doesn't Get Destroyed:**
- Your cloud provider account
- API keys stored in ClawControl
- Other deployments
- Templates

## Destroying a Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch destroy command">
    From ClawControl's main menu:
    
    ```bash
    /destroy
    ```
    
    ClawControl lists all deployments:
    
    ```
    /destroy - Select a deployment to destroy
    
    WARNING: This action cannot be undone!
    
    > my-openclaw-server     [deployed]
      old-test-server        [failed]
      dev-server             [initialized]
    
    Arrow keys to select | Enter to destroy | Esc to go back
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select deployment">
    Use arrow keys to select the deployment you want to destroy and press Enter.
    
    <Tip>
      You can destroy deployments in any state: initialized, deployed, configuring, or failed.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm destruction">
    ClawControl shows what will be deleted and asks for confirmation:
    
    ```
    Confirm Destruction
    
    You are about to destroy:
    Deployment: my-openclaw-server
    Server IP: 159.89.123.45
    
    This will permanently delete:
    • The VPS server (if deployed)
    • All data on the server
    • Local configuration files
    • SSH keys
    
    Type the deployment name to confirm:
    
    Confirm: _
    ```
    
    Type the exact deployment name to confirm:
    
    ```
    Confirm: my-openclaw-server
    ```
    
    Press Enter to proceed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Destruction in progress">
    ClawControl connects to your cloud provider and removes resources:
    
    ```
    Destroying deployment...
    Deleting server and cleaning up resources...
    ```
    
    This typically takes 10-30 seconds.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Destruction complete">
    When finished:
    
    ```
    Deployment Destroyed
    
    The deployment "my-openclaw-server" has been permanently deleted.
    
    Press any key to return to home
    ```
    
    The deployment no longer appears in `/list` or `/status`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens During Destruction

<Steps>
  <Step title="Delete cloud server">
    ClawControl calls your cloud provider's API to delete the VPS:
    
    **Hetzner:**
    ```
    DELETE /servers/{server_id}
    ```
    
    **DigitalOcean:**
    ```
    DELETE /droplets/{droplet_id}
    ```
    
    The server is immediately shut down and scheduled for deletion.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove SSH key">
    The SSH key uploaded during deployment is removed from your cloud provider:
    
    **Hetzner:**
    ```
    DELETE /ssh_keys/{key_id}
    ```
    
    **DigitalOcean:**
    ```
    DELETE /account/keys/{key_id}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clean local files">
    All local files are deleted:
    
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/
    ```
    
    This includes:
    - Configuration and state files
    - SSH key pair
    - Deployment directory
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Special Cases

### Destroying Initialized Deployments

For deployments that were never deployed (status: `initialized`):

1. No cloud resources to delete
2. Only local files are removed
3. Use `/list` → [D]elete instead (faster)

```
/list → Select deployment → Press D
```

### Destroying Failed Deployments

For deployments that failed during provisioning:

1. ClawControl attempts to delete any created resources
2. Even if the server doesn't exist, cleanup succeeds
3. Local files are always removed

<Tip>
  If a deployment failed early, the server may not exist. ClawControl handles this gracefully and completes the cleanup.
</Tip>

### Destroying Multiple Deployments

To destroy multiple deployments:

1. Run `/destroy` for each one individually
2. Confirm each destruction

There's no bulk destroy option for safety.

## Troubleshooting Destruction

### API Key Expired or Invalid

**Problem:** Can't delete server because API key is invalid

**Solution:**

1. Manually delete the server from your cloud provider's dashboard:
   - **Hetzner**: Cloud Console → Servers → Delete
   - **DigitalOcean**: Droplets → Your Server → Destroy

2. Run `/destroy` again - it will skip cloud deletion and clean up local files

### Server Already Deleted

**Problem:** Server was manually deleted from cloud provider

**Solution:**

Run `/destroy` normally. ClawControl detects the server is gone and completes local cleanup.

### Local Files Deleted Manually

**Problem:** Deployment directory was deleted manually

**Solution:**

1. Server still exists in cloud (costing money)
2. Manually delete from cloud provider's dashboard
3. Delete SSH key from cloud provider (search for "clawcontrol-*")

<Warning>
  Always use `/destroy` instead of manually deleting files. Manual deletion leaves cloud resources running and costing money.
</Warning>

### Destruction Hangs

**Problem:** Destruction process is stuck

**Solutions:**

1. Wait 2-3 minutes (cloud providers can be slow)
2. Press Ctrl+C to cancel
3. Check cloud provider dashboard to see if server was deleted
4. Try `/destroy` again

## Cost Implications

### Hourly Billing

Most cloud providers bill by the hour:

**Hetzner:**
- Hourly billing, rounded up
- CPX11: ~$0.007/hour
- Destroy before hour ends to save money

**DigitalOcean:**
- Hourly billing with monthly cap
- s-1vcpu-2gb: $0.018/hour ($12/month cap)
- Destroy anytime to stop charges

### When to Destroy

**Destroy immediately if:**
- Testing is complete
- Deployment failed and you're starting over
- Switching to different configuration
- No longer needed

**Keep running if:**
- Production bot in active use
- Long-running experiments
- Shared with team
- Cost is acceptable

<Tip>
  For development and testing, destroy deployments when not in use to save costs. Recreate when needed (takes ~5-10 minutes).
</Tip>

## Before You Destroy

### Backup Data

If you need to preserve any data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect via SSH">
    ```bash
    /ssh
    ```
    Select your deployment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify important files">
    ```bash
    # OpenClaw configuration
    ~/.openclaw/config.json
    ~/.openclaw/.env
    
    # Logs
    journalctl -u openclaw > openclaw-logs.txt
    
    # Custom data
    /path/to/your/data
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download files">
    From your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    scp -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/NAME/ssh/id_ed25519 \
      root@SERVER_IP:~/.openclaw/config.json \
      ./backup-config.json
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Export Configuration

To recreate the deployment later:

1. Configuration is in `~/.clawcontrol/deployments/NAME/config.json`
2. Copy before destroying:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/config.json ~/backups/
   ```
3. Or fork the deployment to preserve settings:
   ```bash
   /list → Select deployment → Press F
   ```

### Notify Users

If others use this bot:

1. Notify in Telegram/Slack that bot is shutting down
2. Provide timeline for new instance (if applicable)
3. Share new bot credentials when redeployed

## After Destruction

### Verify Cloud Resources Deleted

Check your cloud provider dashboard:

**Hetzner:**
1. Go to [Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
2. Navigate to Servers
3. Verify server is gone
4. Check SSH Keys section

**DigitalOcean:**
1. Go to [Droplets](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets)
2. Verify droplet is gone
3. Check Settings → Security → SSH Keys

### Check Billing

Monitor your cloud provider billing:

- **Hetzner**: Check Cloud Console → Billing
- **DigitalOcean**: Check Billing → Current Usage

Verify charges stopped after destruction.

### Clean Up Tailscale (Optional)

If you used Tailscale:

1. Go to [Tailscale Admin](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)
2. Find the destroyed server
3. Click the "..." menu → Delete

## Alternative: Delete vs Destroy

ClawControl has two deletion commands:

### /destroy

```yaml
When to use: Deployed servers
Deletes:
  - Cloud VPS server
  - Cloud SSH keys
  - Local configuration
  - Local SSH keys
Safety: Type deployment name to confirm
Time: 10-30 seconds
```

### /list → [D]elete

```yaml
When to use: Initialized deployments only
Deletes:
  - Local configuration
  - Local SSH keys
Safety: Type deployment name to confirm
Time: Instant
```

<Tip>
  Use `/destroy` for any deployment that was deployed (even if failed). Use `/list` → [D]elete only for deployments that were never deployed.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

```
1. Create deployment: /new
2. Deploy: /deploy
3. Test functionality
4. Destroy when done: /destroy
5. Repeat with different configuration
```

**Cost for 2 hours of testing:**
- Hetzner CPX11: ~$0.02
- DigitalOcean basic: ~$0.04

### Production Workflow

```
1. Create deployment: /new
2. Deploy: /deploy
3. Test thoroughly
4. Monitor with /status and /logs
5. Keep running
6. Destroy only when replacing or retiring
```

### Multi-Instance Strategy

```
dev-server:     Create/destroy frequently
staging-server: Keep running during development
prod-server:    Keep running continuously
```

Only destroy production when:
- Migrating to new infrastructure
- No longer needed
- Major configuration change required

## Recovery

<Warning>
  Once a deployment is destroyed, it CANNOT be recovered. The server and all its data are permanently deleted.
</Warning>

**If you destroyed by mistake:**

1. **Server data**: Lost permanently
2. **Configuration**: Gone if not backed up
3. **Recreation**: Deploy fresh instance with similar config

**To minimize risk:**
- Always confirm the deployment name carefully
- Keep templates of common configurations
- Document API keys externally
- Back up important data regularly

## Next Steps

- [First Deployment](/guides/first-deployment) - Create a new deployment
- [Using Templates](/guides/using-templates) - Quickly recreate destroyed deployments
- [Managing Deployments](/guides/managing-deployments) - Fork before destroying to preserve config
