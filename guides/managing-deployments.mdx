Once you've created deployments, ClawControl provides tools to manage them throughout their lifecycle.

## Viewing All Deployments

<Steps>
  <Step title="List deployments">
    From the main menu:
    
    ```bash
    /list
    ```
    
    You'll see all your deployments:
    
    ```
    /list - Deployments (3)
    
    > my-openclaw-server     [deployed]      Hetzner Cloud
      dev-server             [initialized]   DigitalOcean
      old-server             [failed]        Hetzner Cloud
    ```
    
    Status meanings:
    - **initialized**: Configuration created, not yet deployed
    - **provisioning**: Server is being created
    - **configuring**: Software is being installed
    - **deployed**: Fully operational
    - **failed**: Deployment encountered an error
  </Step>

  <Step title="View deployment details">
    Press Enter on any deployment to see full details:
    
    ```
    /list - my-openclaw-server
    
    Deployment Details
    
    Name:         my-openclaw-server
    Status:       deployed
    Provider:     Hetzner Cloud
    Created:      1/15/2026, 2:30:45 PM
    Server IP:    159.89.123.45
    Server Type:  cpx11
    AI Provider:  openrouter
    Model:        moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
    Channel:      telegram
    
    [E]dit  [F]ork  [D]elete (use /destroy)
    
    Esc: Back to list
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Checking Deployment Status

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open status view">
    ```bash
    /status
    ```
    
    This shows all deployments with detailed status information:
    
    ```
    /status - Deployment Status
    
    Deployments (2)
    > my-openclaw-server     [deployed]
      dev-server             [initialized]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a deployment">
    Use arrow keys to select a deployment:
    
    ```
    Details: my-openclaw-server
    
    Status:         deployed
    Provider:       hetzner
    Server IP:      159.89.123.45
    Tailscale IP:   100.64.1.23
    Created:        1/15/2026, 2:30:45 PM
    Deployed:       1/15/2026, 2:45:12 PM
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run health check">
    Press Enter to check if the deployment is healthy:
    
    ```
    Health Check:
    SSH:        Connected
    OpenClaw:   Running
    Last checked: 3:45:12 PM
    ```
    
    This verifies:
    - SSH connection is working
    - OpenClaw daemon is running
    - Server is responsive
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing Deployments

You can edit deployments that haven't been deployed yet (status: `initialized`).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select deployment">
    Go to `/list`, select an initialized deployment, and press `E` for edit:
    
    ```
    [E]dit  [F]ork  [D]elete
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      You can only edit deployments with status "initialized". Deployed servers must be destroyed and recreated to change settings.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update settings">
    The edit wizard lets you change:
    
    - Cloud provider API key
    - Server size (DigitalOcean only)
    - AI provider and API key
    - Model
    - Telegram bot token
    - Telegram allowed users
    
    Settings you CANNOT change:
    - Deployment name
    - Cloud provider
    - AI provider
    
    To change these, fork the deployment instead.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save changes">
    After making changes, confirm to update the deployment:
    
    ```
    Configuration Summary:
    
    Name:         dev-server
    Provider:     DigitalOcean
    AI Provider:  OpenAI
    Model:        gpt-4o-mini
    
    Press Y to confirm, N to go back
    ```
    
    The deployment configuration is updated immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Forking Deployments

Forking creates a copy of an existing deployment with a new name. This is useful for:

- Creating multiple similar deployments
- Testing configuration changes
- Migrating between providers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start fork">
    From `/list`, select any deployment and press `F`:
    
    ```
    [E]dit  [F]ork  [D]elete
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      You can fork any deployment, regardless of status (initialized, deployed, or failed).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name the fork">
    Choose a unique name for the forked deployment:
    
    ```
    Step 1: Deployment Name
    Enter a unique name for this deployment:
    
    Name: my-openclaw-server-2
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize settings">
    The fork wizard walks through each setting, pre-filled with values from the original:
    
    - Cloud provider API key
    - Server size (if DigitalOcean)
    - AI provider API key
    - Model
    - Telegram credentials
    - Tailscale preference
    
    You can keep the same values or change them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create fork">
    Confirm to create the forked deployment:
    
    ```
    Configuration Summary:
    
    Name:         my-openclaw-server-2
    Provider:     Hetzner Cloud
    AI Provider:  OpenRouter
    Model:        moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
    
    Press Y to confirm, N to go back
    ```
    
    The new deployment is created with status "initialized".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deleting Local Configurations

Delete deployments that haven't been deployed yet:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select initialized deployment">
    From `/list`, select a deployment with status "initialized" and press `D`:
    
    ```
    [E]dit  [F]ork  [D]elete
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      If a deployment is deployed or failed, use `/destroy` instead. The [D]elete option won't work.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    Type the deployment name to confirm:
    
    ```
    Confirm Deletion
    
    You are about to delete:
    Deployment: dev-server
    
    This will permanently delete:
      Local configuration files
      SSH keys
    
    Type the deployment name to confirm:
    
    Confirm: dev-server
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deletion complete">
    The deployment is removed from your local configuration:
    
    ```
    Deployment Deleted
    
    The deployment "dev-server" has been permanently deleted.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment States

Understanding deployment states helps you manage them effectively:

### Initialized

```yaml
Status: initialized
Server: Not created
Actions: Edit, Deploy, Fork, Delete
```

Configuration exists locally but no cloud resources have been created.

**What you can do:**
- Edit configuration
- Deploy to cloud
- Fork to create copy
- Delete locally

### Provisioning

```yaml
Status: provisioning
Server: Being created
Actions: Monitor progress
```

Cloud server is being created. ClawControl is:
- Creating VPS instance
- Uploading SSH keys
- Waiting for server to boot

**What you can do:**
- Watch deployment progress
- Wait for completion

### Configuring

```yaml
Status: configuring
Server: Installing software
Actions: Monitor progress
```

Server is created and ClawControl is:
- Installing system updates
- Installing Node.js, Chrome
- Installing and configuring OpenClaw
- Setting up Tailscale (if enabled)

**What you can do:**
- Watch deployment progress
- Wait for completion

### Deployed

```yaml
Status: deployed
Server: Fully operational
Actions: SSH, Logs, Status, Fork, Destroy
```

Deployment is complete and OpenClaw is running.

**What you can do:**
- SSH into server
- View logs
- Check health status
- Fork for similar deployment
- Destroy when done

### Failed

```yaml
Status: failed
Server: Deployment error
Actions: View logs, Retry, Destroy
```

Deployment encountered an error and stopped.

**What you can do:**
- Check error message in status
- Run `/deploy` to retry (resumes from last checkpoint)
- Run `/logs` to diagnose
- Run `/destroy` to clean up and start over

## Finding Deployments

As you create more deployments, use these strategies to stay organized:

### Naming Conventions

```
Good examples:
- prod-telegram-bot
- dev-testing-server
- personal-assistant-1
- team-demo-instance

Bad examples:
- server
- test
- asdf
- openclaw-1
```

### Status Filtering

In `/list` and `/status`, deployments are shown with their status. Use this to quickly identify:

- Active deployments: `[deployed]`
- Ready to deploy: `[initialized]`
- Need attention: `[failed]`

### Multiple Deployments

<Tip>
  Common patterns:
  - **Development + Production**: `dev-server` and `prod-server`
  - **Multiple models**: `server-gpt4` and `server-claude`
  - **Regional**: `server-us` and `server-eu`
  - **Testing**: `test-new-model` (temporary)
</Tip>

## Managing SSH Keys

ClawControl generates unique SSH keys for each deployment:

```
~/.clawcontrol/
├── deployments/
│   └── my-openclaw-server/
│       ├── ssh/
│       │   ├── id_ed25519          # Private key
│       │   └── id_ed25519.pub      # Public key
│       ├── config.json             # Deployment config
│       └── state.json              # Deployment state
```

**SSH keys are:**
- Automatically generated during deployment
- Unique to each deployment
- Deleted when you destroy a deployment
- Not reused across deployments

<Warning>
  If you manually delete deployment files, you'll lose access to the server. Always use `/destroy` to clean up properly.
</Warning>

## Configuration Files

Deployment data is stored locally:

### config.json

Stores your deployment configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "my-openclaw-server",
  "provider": "hetzner",
  "createdAt": "2026-01-15T14:30:45.123Z",
  "hetzner": {
    "apiKey": "...",
    "serverType": "cpx11",
    "location": "ash",
    "image": "ubuntu-24.04"
  },
  "openclawAgent": {
    "aiProvider": "openrouter",
    "aiApiKey": "...",
    "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5",
    "channel": "telegram",
    "telegramBotToken": "...",
    "telegramAllowFrom": "123456789"
  }
}
```

### state.json

Tracks deployment progress:

```json
{
  "status": "deployed",
  "serverId": "12345678",
  "serverIp": "159.89.123.45",
  "tailscaleIp": "100.64.1.23",
  "deployedAt": "2026-01-15T14:45:12.456Z",
  "checkpoints": [
    {
      "name": "server_created",
      "completedAt": "2026-01-15T14:31:23.789Z",
      "retryCount": 0
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
