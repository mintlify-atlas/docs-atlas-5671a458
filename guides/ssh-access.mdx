ClawControl makes it easy to SSH into your deployed OpenClaw instances for debugging, configuration, and administration.

## Understanding SSH Access

When you deploy an OpenClaw instance, ClawControl:

1. Generates a unique ED25519 SSH key pair
2. Uploads the public key to your cloud provider
3. Configures the server to accept your key
4. Stores the private key locally at `~/.clawcontrol/deployments/NAME/ssh/id_ed25519`

<Tip>
  Each deployment has its own SSH key for security isolation. If one key is compromised, your other deployments remain secure.
</Tip>

## Quick SSH Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch SSH">
    From ClawControl's main menu:
    
    ```bash
    /ssh
    ```
    
    ClawControl detects your terminal and shows available deployments:
    
    ```
    /ssh - Select a deployment to connect
    
    > my-openclaw-server     159.89.123.45
      prod-server            142.93.45.67
    
    Terminal: iTerm2 (will open in a new window)
    
    Arrow keys to select | Enter to connect | Esc to go back
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select deployment">
    Use arrow keys to select a deployment and press Enter.
    
    ClawControl opens a new terminal window/tab with an active SSH session:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519 \
      -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
      -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
      root@159.89.123.45
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      ClawControl automatically handles SSH options to avoid fingerprint warnings.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connected">
    You're now connected to your server as root:
    
    ```bash
    root@my-openclaw-server:~#
    ```
    
    Back in ClawControl, you'll see a confirmation:
    
    ```
    SSH Session Opened
    A new iTerm2 window/tab has been opened.
    
    Your SSH session is running in iTerm2.
    When you're done, type 'exit' or close the tab.
    
    Press Enter or Esc to return to ClawControl
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Terminals

ClawControl automatically detects and supports:

- **macOS**: Terminal.app, iTerm2, Warp, Hyper, Alacritty, Kitty
- **Linux**: gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, xfce4-terminal, terminator
- **Windows**: Windows Terminal, cmd.exe, PowerShell

<Tip>
  ClawControl picks the best terminal available on your system. Set the `TERMINAL` environment variable to override detection.
</Tip>

## Manual SSH Connection

You can also connect manually without ClawControl:

### Get Connection Details

From `/status` or `/list`, note your deployment's:
- Deployment name
- Server IP address

### Connect via Terminal

```bash
ssh -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_NAME/ssh/id_ed25519 \
  root@SERVER_IP
```

Example:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519 \
  root@159.89.123.45
```

### Add to SSH Config

For frequent access, add to `~/.ssh/config`:

```ssh-config
Host my-openclaw
    HostName 159.89.123.45
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
```

Then connect with:
```bash
ssh my-openclaw
```

## Common SSH Tasks

### Check OpenClaw Status

```bash
systemctl status openclaw
```

Output:
```
● openclaw.service - OpenClaw Agent
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/openclaw.service; enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2026-01-15 14:45:23 UTC
   Main PID: 1234 (node)
      Tasks: 11 (limit: 2339)
     Memory: 245.6M
        CPU: 1min 23.456s
```

### View OpenClaw Logs

```bash
journalctl -u openclaw -f
```

This follows logs in real-time. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

### Restart OpenClaw

```bash
systemctl restart openclaw
```

### Check System Resources

```bash
# CPU and memory usage
htop

# Disk space
df -h

# Memory info
free -h
```

### Update OpenClaw

```bash
# Load NVM
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh

# Update OpenClaw
cd ~/.openclaw
npm update -g @openclaw/core

# Restart service
systemctl restart openclaw
```

### Check Network Connectivity

```bash
# Test internet
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8

# Check open ports
ss -tulpn | grep LISTEN

# Test Tailscale (if configured)
tailscale status
```

## Advanced SSH Usage

### Port Forwarding

Access the OpenClaw gateway through an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519 \
  -L 8080:localhost:18789 \
  root@159.89.123.45
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

<Tip>
  This is useful when Tailscale isn't configured and you don't want to expose the gateway publicly.
</Tip>

### Copy Files to Server

```bash
scp -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519 \
  local-file.json root@159.89.123.45:/root/
```

### Copy Files from Server

```bash
scp -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519 \
  root@159.89.123.45:/root/logs.txt .
```

### Run Remote Command

Execute a command without interactive session:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519 \
  root@159.89.123.45 "systemctl status openclaw"
```

## Troubleshooting SSH

### Connection Timeout

**Problem:** SSH connection times out

**Solutions:**

1. Verify server is running in your cloud provider's dashboard
2. Check server IP address hasn't changed
3. Verify firewall allows SSH (port 22)
4. Try from `/status` to see if server is reachable

### Permission Denied

**Problem:** `Permission denied (publickey)`

**Solutions:**

1. Verify you're using the correct SSH key:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_NAME/ssh/
   ```

2. Check key permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_NAME/ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

3. Ensure you're using the deployment name correctly

### Host Key Verification Failed

**Problem:** SSH warns about host key mismatch

This happens if you destroyed and recreated a server with the same IP.

**Solution:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -R SERVER_IP
```

Or use ClawControl's `/ssh` which bypasses known_hosts checking.

### Terminal Doesn't Open

**Problem:** ClawControl can't open terminal

**Solutions:**

1. Check error message for details
2. Try manual SSH connection
3. Set `TERMINAL` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export TERMINAL=gnome-terminal
   clawcontrol
   ```

4. Use manual SSH as fallback

## SSH Security

### Key Management

<Warning>
  Never share your private SSH keys. They provide root access to your servers.
</Warning>

**Best practices:**

- Keys are stored with restrictive permissions (600)
- Each deployment has isolated keys
- Keys are deleted when you run `/destroy`
- Don't copy keys to insecure locations

### Access Control

By default, servers only accept:
- SSH key authentication (no passwords)
- Connections from ClawControl's generated key
- Root user access

### Firewall Configuration

Cloud providers typically allow SSH by default. To restrict:

**Hetzner:**
1. Go to Cloud Console
2. Select your server
3. Firewalls → Create Firewall
4. Allow SSH only from your IP

**DigitalOcean:**
1. Go to Networking → Firewalls
2. Create Firewall
3. Allow SSH only from your IP
4. Apply to your droplet

## SSH with Tailscale

If you enabled Tailscale during deployment:

### Connect via Tailscale IP

```bash
ssh -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519 \
  root@100.64.1.23
```

<Tip>
  Tailscale IPs (100.x.x.x) are only accessible from devices on your Tailscale network, providing an extra security layer.
</Tip>

### Benefits

- **Security**: Only accessible from your Tailscale network
- **No public SSH**: Disable SSH on public IP
- **NAT traversal**: Works behind firewalls
- **Encrypted**: End-to-end encryption

## VS Code Remote SSH

Connect VS Code to your server:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Remote-SSH extension">
    In VS Code, install the "Remote - SSH" extension.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add SSH host">
    Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows)
    
    Select: "Remote-SSH: Add New SSH Host"
    
    Enter:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/my-openclaw-server/ssh/id_ed25519 root@159.89.123.45
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect">
    Press `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"
    
    Select your server.
    
    VS Code opens a new window connected to your server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now you can:
- Edit files directly on the server
- Run terminal commands
- Debug Node.js applications
- Use VS Code extensions remotely
