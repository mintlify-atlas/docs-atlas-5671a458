Hetzner Cloud is a European cloud provider known for competitive pricing and reliable infrastructure. ClawControl provides full support for Hetzner, making it easy to deploy OpenClaw instances.

## API Key Setup

Before deploying to Hetzner, you need to obtain an API key:

1. Sign up for a [Hetzner Cloud account](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
2. Navigate to your project in the Hetzner Cloud Console
3. Go to **Security** → **API Tokens**
4. Click **Generate API Token**
5. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "ClawControl")
6. Select **Read & Write** permissions
7. Copy the token immediately (it won't be shown again)

<Warning>
  Store your API key securely. Anyone with this key can create and manage servers in your Hetzner project.
</Warning>

## Configuration Options

Hetzner deployments support the following configuration options:

### Server Type

Choose from various server types based on your needs:

| Server Type | vCPUs | RAM | Disk | Price/Month (US East) |
|-------------|-------|-----|------|----------------------|
| **cpx11** (default) | 2 | 2 GB | 40 GB | ~$4.99 |
| cpx21 | 3 | 4 GB | 80 GB | ~$9.99 |
| cpx31 | 4 | 8 GB | 160 GB | ~$19.99 |
| cpx41 | 8 | 16 GB | 240 GB | ~$39.99 |

<Tip>
  The **cpx11** server type is recommended for basic OpenClaw deployments and provides excellent value.
</Tip>

### Location

Available Hetzner locations:

- **ash** (Ashburn, VA, USA) - Default, lowest latency for US East
- **fsn1** (Falkenstein, Germany)
- **nbg1** (Nuremberg, Germany)
- **hel1** (Helsinki, Finland)
- **hil** (Hillsboro, OR, USA)

### Image

ClawControl uses **ubuntu-24.04** as the default operating system image, which is fully tested and supported.

## Default Configuration

When you create a new Hetzner deployment, these defaults are used:

```typescript
{
  apiKey: string,           // Your Hetzner API key
  serverType: "cpx11",      // 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM
  location: "ash",          // Ashburn, VA (US East)
  image: "ubuntu-24.04"     // Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
}
```

## Creating a Deployment

Using the ClawControl CLI:

```bash
clawcontrol /new
```

Select **Hetzner** as your provider and provide:

1. **Deployment Name**: A unique identifier for this deployment
2. **API Key**: Your Hetzner API token
3. **Server Type**: Choose from available options (default: cpx11)
4. **Location**: Select a datacenter location (default: ash)
5. **OpenClaw Configuration**: AI provider, model, and channel settings

## Deployment Process

When you run `/deploy`, ClawControl will:

1. **Create SSH Key**: Generates and uploads an SSH key to Hetzner
2. **Provision Server**: Creates a new server with your specifications
3. **Configure System**: Installs Node.js, Chrome, and dependencies
4. **Install OpenClaw**: Deploys and configures the OpenClaw agent
5. **Setup Tailscale**: Configures secure VPN access (optional)
6. **Start Services**: Launches OpenClaw as a systemd service

<Note>
  The entire deployment process typically takes 5-10 minutes depending on server provisioning time.
</Note>

## API Operations

ClawControl uses the Hetzner Cloud API to manage your deployment:

### Server Management
- Create, delete, and list servers
- Power on/off and reboot operations
- Monitor server status and wait for ready state

### SSH Key Management
- Upload public SSH keys for secure access
- List and delete SSH keys
- Retrieve SSH key details by ID

### Resource Information
- List available server types and pricing
- Query available locations and regions
- Check action status and progress

## Monitoring Your Deployment

After deployment, use these commands to monitor your instance:

```bash
# View deployment status
clawcontrol /status

# SSH into your server
clawcontrol /ssh

# View OpenClaw logs
clawcontrol /logs
```

## Pricing and Billing

Hetzner charges are:
- **Hourly billing** with monthly caps
- **No data transfer fees** for the first 20TB
- **Automated billing** charged to your payment method

<Tip>
  You can view detailed pricing in the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) under your project's billing section.
</Tip>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Server Types

If you need more resources, you can specify different server types:

- **CX series**: Shared vCPU (cost-effective)
- **CPX series**: Dedicated vCPU (balanced, default)
- **CCX series**: High-performance dedicated CPUs

### Regional Considerations

Choose your location based on:
- **Latency**: Select the region closest to your users
- **Compliance**: EU regions for GDPR compliance
- **Pricing**: Prices may vary slightly by region

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

If you encounter authentication errors:

1. Verify your API key has **Read & Write** permissions
2. Ensure the token hasn't been deleted or expired
3. Check that you're using the correct project

### Server Creation Failures

Common issues:
- **Quota limits**: Check your Hetzner project limits
- **Region availability**: Try a different location if servers are unavailable
- **Resource limits**: Ensure your account has sufficient resources

### Connection Problems

If SSH connection fails:

1. Verify the server is in "running" state
2. Check that SSH keys were properly uploaded
3. Ensure your local SSH client is configured correctly

## Cleanup and Deletion

To remove a deployment:

```bash
clawcontrol /destroy
```

This will:
- Delete the server from Hetzner
- Remove uploaded SSH keys
- Clean up local configuration files

<Warning>
  Destroying a deployment is permanent. Make sure to backup any important data before deletion.
