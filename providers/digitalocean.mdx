DigitalOcean is a global cloud infrastructure provider with extensive region coverage. ClawControl provides full support for DigitalOcean Droplets, making it easy to deploy OpenClaw instances worldwide.

## API Token Setup

Before deploying to DigitalOcean, you need to create an API token:

1. Sign up for a [DigitalOcean account](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/)
2. Navigate to **API** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Generate New Token**
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "ClawControl")
5. Select **Read & Write** scopes
6. Click **Generate Token**
7. Copy the token immediately (it won't be shown again)

<Warning>
  Store your API token securely. Anyone with this token can create and manage resources in your DigitalOcean account.
</Warning>

## Configuration Options

DigitalOcean deployments support the following configuration options:

### Droplet Size

Choose from various droplet sizes based on your needs:

| Size | vCPUs | RAM | Disk | Transfer | Price/Month |
|------|-------|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| **s-1vcpu-2gb** (default) | 1 | 2 GB | 50 GB | 2 TB | $12 |
| s-2vcpu-2gb | 2 | 2 GB | 60 GB | 3 TB | $18 |
| s-2vcpu-4gb | 2 | 4 GB | 80 GB | 4 TB | $24 |
| s-4vcpu-8gb | 4 | 8 GB | 160 GB | 5 TB | $48 |

<Tip>
  The **s-1vcpu-2gb** size is recommended for basic OpenClaw deployments and provides reliable performance.
</Tip>

### Region

Available DigitalOcean regions:

**North America:**
- **nyc1** (New York City 1) - Default
- **nyc3** (New York City 3)
- **sfo3** (San Francisco 3)
- **tor1** (Toronto 1)

**Europe:**
- **ams3** (Amsterdam 3)
- **lon1** (London 1)
- **fra1** (Frankfurt 1)

**Asia-Pacific:**
- **sgp1** (Singapore 1)
- **blr1** (Bangalore 1)

### Image

ClawControl uses **ubuntu-24-04-x64** as the default operating system image, which is fully tested and supported.

## Default Configuration

When you create a new DigitalOcean deployment, these defaults are used:

```typescript
{
  apiKey: string,              // Your DigitalOcean API token
  size: "s-1vcpu-2gb",         // 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM
  region: "nyc1",              // New York City
  image: "ubuntu-24-04-x64"   // Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
}
```

## Creating a Deployment

Using the ClawControl CLI:

```bash
clawcontrol /new
```

Select **DigitalOcean** as your provider and provide:

1. **Deployment Name**: A unique identifier for this deployment
2. **API Token**: Your DigitalOcean API token
3. **Droplet Size**: Choose from available options (default: s-1vcpu-2gb)
4. **Region**: Select a datacenter location (default: nyc1)
5. **OpenClaw Configuration**: AI provider, model, and channel settings

## Deployment Process

When you run `/deploy`, ClawControl will:

1. **Create SSH Key**: Generates and uploads an SSH key to DigitalOcean
2. **Provision Droplet**: Creates a new droplet with your specifications
3. **Configure System**: Installs Node.js, Chrome, and dependencies
4. **Install OpenClaw**: Deploys and configures the OpenClaw agent
5. **Setup Tailscale**: Configures secure VPN access (optional)
6. **Start Services**: Launches OpenClaw as a systemd service

<Note>
  The entire deployment process typically takes 5-10 minutes depending on droplet provisioning time.
</Note>

## API Operations

ClawControl uses the DigitalOcean API to manage your deployment:

### Droplet Management
- Create, delete, and list droplets
- Power on/off, reboot, and shutdown operations
- Monitor droplet status and wait for active state

### SSH Key Management
- Upload public SSH keys for secure access
- List and delete SSH keys (by ID or fingerprint)
- Retrieve SSH key details

### Resource Information
- List available droplet sizes and pricing
- Query available regions and availability
- Check action status and completion

## Monitoring Your Deployment

After deployment, use these commands to monitor your instance:

```bash
# View deployment status
clawcontrol /status

# SSH into your droplet
clawcontrol /ssh

# View OpenClaw logs
clawcontrol /logs
```

## Pricing and Billing

DigitalOcean charges are:
- **Hourly billing** with monthly caps
- **Predictable pricing** based on droplet size
- **No bandwidth overage fees** within transfer limits
- **Automated billing** charged to your payment method

<Tip>
  You can view detailed pricing and usage in the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/billing) under Billing.
</Tip>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Droplet Sizes

If you need more resources, DigitalOcean offers:

- **Basic droplets**: Cost-effective shared CPU
- **General Purpose**: Dedicated CPU with balanced resources
- **CPU-Optimized**: High CPU-to-memory ratio
- **Memory-Optimized**: High memory-to-CPU ratio

### Optional Features

When creating droplets, you can enable:

- **Backups**: Automated weekly backups (+20% of droplet cost)
- **IPv6**: Enable IPv6 networking (free)
- **User Data**: Cloud-init scripts for custom provisioning
- **Tags**: Organize and filter your droplets

### Regional Considerations

Choose your region based on:
- **Latency**: Select the region closest to your users
- **Compliance**: EU regions for GDPR compliance
- **Features**: Some features may vary by region

## Troubleshooting

### API Token Issues

If you encounter authentication errors:

1. Verify your API token has **Read & Write** scopes
2. Ensure the token hasn't been deleted or revoked
3. Check that you're logged into the correct account

### Droplet Creation Failures

Common issues:
- **Quota limits**: Check your account droplet limits
- **Region availability**: Try a different region if droplets are unavailable
- **Payment issues**: Ensure your payment method is valid

### Connection Problems

If SSH connection fails:

1. Verify the droplet is in "active" state
2. Check that SSH keys were properly uploaded
3. Ensure firewall rules allow SSH (port 22)
4. Verify your local SSH client configuration

## Cleanup and Deletion

To remove a deployment:

```bash
clawcontrol /destroy
```

This will:
- Delete the droplet from DigitalOcean
- Remove uploaded SSH keys
- Clean up local configuration files

<Warning>
  Destroying a deployment is permanent. Make sure to backup any important data before deletion.
</Warning>
