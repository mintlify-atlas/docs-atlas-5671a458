    ```text Anthropic
    claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
    ```
    
    ```text OpenAI  
    gpt-4o
    gpt-4o-mini
    o1-preview
    ```
    
    ```text Google
    gemini-2.0-flash

    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Tailscale (optional)">
    Choose whether to set up Tailscale for secure access:
    
    - **Skip** - Dashboard accessible via server IP only
    - **Configure Tailscale** - Secure private VPN access (recommended)
    
    Tailscale creates a private network so only you can access the OpenClaw dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm configuration">
    Review your settings and press `Y` to create the deployment configuration.
    
    ```
    Deployment Name: my-openclaw-server
    Provider: Hetzner (CPX11, Ashburn)
    AI Provider: Anthropic (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
    Telegram: Configured
    Tailscale: Enabled
    
    Press Y to confirm, N to cancel
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Deploy to VPS

Now that your deployment is configured, it's time to provision the infrastructure.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run /deploy command">
    From the home screen, type `/deploy` and press Enter.
    
    ```bash
    > /deploy
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select deployment">
    Choose the deployment you just created:
    
    ```
    > my-openclaw-server  [initialized]  hetzner
    ```
    
    Press Enter to continue.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm deployment">
    Review the deployment details and costs:
    
    ```
    Deploy "my-openclaw-server"?
    
    This will:
    • Create a VPS on hetzner
    • Install and configure OpenClaw  
    • Set up Tailscale for secure access
    
    Estimated cost: ~$4.99/month (Hetzner CPX11)
    
    Press Y to confirm, N to cancel
    ```
    
    Press `Y` to begin deployment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Watch deployment progress">
    ClawControl will now execute all deployment checkpoints automatically:
    
    ```
    [1/15] Creating VPS server...
    [2/15] Uploading SSH keys...
    [3/15] Connecting via SSH...
    [4/15] Setting up swap memory...
    [5/15] Updating system packages...
    [6/15] Installing NVM...
    [7/15] Installing Node.js...
    [8/15] Installing pnpm...
    [9/15] Installing Google Chrome...
    [10/15] Installing OpenClaw...
    [11/15] Configuring OpenClaw...
    [12/15] Installing Tailscale...
    ```
    
    This process typically takes 5-10 minutes depending on your provider and network speed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate Tailscale">
    If you enabled Tailscale, ClawControl will prompt you to authenticate:
    
    ```
    Tailscale needs authentication.
    
    Tailscale is a secure networking tool that creates a private VPN 
    between your devices and your OpenClaw server, so the gateway is 
    only accessible to you.
    
    Would you like to open your browser to authenticate?
    
    URL: https://login.tailscale.com/a/...
    ```
    
    Press `Y` to open your browser, log in with your Tailscale account (or create one), and authorize the device.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start OpenClaw daemon">
    The final checkpoint starts the OpenClaw systemd service:
    
    ```
    [15/15] Starting OpenClaw daemon...
    OpenClaw daemon is running.
    
    Your OpenClaw config has been applied and the daemon is running.
    
    Would you like to also run 'openclaw onboard' interactively for 
    additional setup? (This is optional — your agent is already configured.)
    ```
    
    - Press `Y` to run the interactive onboarding in a terminal window
    - Press `N` to skip (the daemon is already configured and running)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Verify deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check deployment status">
    From the home screen, type `/status` and press Enter:
    
    ```bash
    > /status
    ```
    
    You'll see your deployment details:
    
    ```
    Details: my-openclaw-server
    Status:          deployed
    Provider:        hetzner
    Server IP:       1.2.3.4
    Tailscale IP:    100.64.0.1
    Created:         1/15/2026, 10:30:00 AM
    Deployed:        1/15/2026, 10:42:00 AM
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run health check">
    With your deployment selected in `/status`, press Enter to run a health check:
    
    ```
    Health Check:
    SSH:         Connected
    OpenClaw:    Running
    Last checked: 10:45:30 AM
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access OpenClaw dashboard">
    Type `/dashboard` and select your deployment to open the web interface:
    
    ```bash
    > /dashboard
    ```
    
    If Tailscale is configured, the dashboard will open at your Tailscale IP. Otherwise, it uses the public server IP.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deployment fails at 'Creating VPS server'">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Invalid API key
    - Insufficient account credits  
    - Region quota exceeded
    - Name already in use
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Verify your API key is correct and has permissions
    2. Check your provider account has available credits
    3. Try a different deployment name
    4. Run `/destroy` to clean up any partial resources, then try again
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SSH connection timeout">
    The server may still be booting or there's a network issue.
    
    **Solutions:**
    1. Wait 2-3 minutes and let ClawControl retry automatically
    2. Check your provider's console to verify the server is running
    3. Ensure port 22 (SSH) is not blocked by firewall rules
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="OpenClaw daemon not running after deployment">
    Check the daemon status:
    
    ```bash
    clawcontrol
    > /ssh
    # In the SSH session:
    systemctl status openclaw
    journalctl -u openclaw -f
    ```
    
    Common issues:
    - Missing or invalid API keys in environment
    - Telegram token authentication failed
    - Out of memory (increase server size)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tailscale authentication not completing">
    If you miss the authentication window:
    
    1. SSH into your server: `/ssh`
    2. Run: `sudo tailscale up`
    3. Open the authentication URL manually
    4. Complete authentication
    5. Run: `sudo tailscale serve https / http://127.0.0.1:8888`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deployment stuck on a checkpoint">
    ClawControl will retry failed steps up to 3 times. If a checkpoint keeps failing:
    
    1. Check the error message for specific details
    2. Press `N` when asked to retry from beginning
    3. Use `/ssh` to investigate the server directly
    4. Fix the issue manually or `/destroy` and start fresh
  </Accordion>
