The `/destroy` command permanently deletes a deployment, including the cloud server, SSH keys, and local configuration files. This action cannot be undone.

<Warning>
  This is a destructive operation. All data on the server will be lost permanently. Make sure you have backups of any important data before destroying a deployment.
</Warning>

## Usage

```
/destroy
```

```

## What Gets Deleted

### Cloud Resources

1. **VPS Server** - The virtual machine is destroyed
2. **Server Data** - All files and data on the server
3. **Cloud SSH Key** - Public key uploaded to the provider
4. **Assigned IP** - Server IP address is released

### Local Resources

1. **SSH Keys** - Private key file (`.pem`)
2. **Configuration** - Deployment config (`.json`)
3. **State Files** - Deployment state and checkpoints
4. **Directory** - Entire deployment directory

### What Doesn't Get Deleted

- **Saved API Keys** - Reusable across deployments
- **Saved Tokens** - Telegram bot tokens, etc.
- **Templates** - Custom templates you've created
- **Other Deployments** - Only the selected deployment is affected

## Example Terminal Session

```
> /destroy

/destroy - Select a deployment to destroy

WARNING: This action cannot be undone!

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐

Type the deployment name to confirm:
Confirm: old-test-server

[Enter]

Destroying deployment...

## Error Handling

### Server Already Deleted

If the cloud server no longer exists:

```
Destroying deployment...

⚠ Warning: Server not found in cloud provider
  (May have been manually deleted)

✓ Cleaned up local configuration
✓ Deployment Destroyed
```

ClawControl continues with local cleanup.

### API Error

```
Destruction Failed

Failed to delete server: API authentication failed

Local configuration has been preserved.
Check your API key and try again.

Press any key to go back
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify API key is still valid
2. Try again: `/destroy`
3. Manually delete via cloud provider console
4. Run `/destroy` again to clean up local files

### Partial Failure

```
Destroying deployment...

✓ Deleted VPS from Hetzner Cloud
✗ Failed to delete SSH key (key not found)
✓ Removed local configuration

✓ Deployment Destroyed

Note: Some cloud resources may remain.
Check your provider's console to verify cleanup.
```

## Empty State

If no deployments exist:

```
/destroy - Destroy deployment

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ No deployments found!                      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Press any key to return to home
```

## Recovery

<Warning>
  There is no undo or recovery option. Destroyed deployments cannot be restored.
</Warning>

If you accidentally destroy a deployment:

1. **Create a new deployment** with `/new`
2. **Reconfigure** with the same settings
3. **Redeploy** with `/deploy`

Your data on the server is lost, but you can recreate the deployment configuration.

## Best Practices

### Before Destroying

1. **Backup Data**
   ```bash
   # SSH into server
   > /ssh
   
   # Backup important files
   root@server:~# tar -czf backup.tar.gz /root/.openclaw/
   root@server:~# exit
   
   # Download backup
   scp -i ~/.clawcontrol/deployments/name/ssh_key.pem \
       root@server:/root/backup.tar.gz .
   ```

2. **Export Configuration**
   - Templates preserve configuration for reuse
   - Create a template before destroying: `/templates`

3. **Verify You're Destroying the Right One**
   - Check with `/status` first
   - Note the server IP
   - Confirm it's the deployment you intend to destroy

### After Destroying

1. **Verify Cloud Cleanup**
   - Log into your cloud provider console
   - Confirm the server is deleted
   - Verify you're not being billed

2. **Clean Saved Keys (Optional)**
   - Saved API keys persist after destruction
   - Manually remove from `~/.clawcontrol/secrets/` if needed

## Use Cases

### Remove Test Deployment

```
# After testing
> /destroy
# Select: test-instance
# Confirm: test-instance
# ✓ Destroyed
```

### Replace Production Deployment

```
# Create new config with updated settings
> /new
Name: production-claude-v2

# Deploy new instance
> /deploy

# Verify new instance works
> /status
> /ssh

# Destroy old instance
> /destroy
# Select: production-claude
```

### Clean Up Failed Deployment

```
# Deployment failed and can't be fixed
> /destroy
# Select: broken-instance

# Start fresh
> /new
```

## Cost Savings

<Tip>
  Destroy unused deployments to avoid ongoing cloud costs. Even "stopped" instances may incur charges.
</Tip>

Hetzner CPX11: $4.99/month
- 1 deployment = $4.99/month
- 3 deployments = $14.97/month
- Destroying saves real money!

## Tips

<Tip>
  Create templates before destroying production deployments. This makes it easy to recreate the same configuration later.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Destroying a deployment that has an active `/dashboard` or `/ssh` connection will cause those connections to fail. Close them first.
</Note>
