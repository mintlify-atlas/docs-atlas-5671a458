description: Deploy a configured instance to the cloud
---

The `/deploy` command deploys a previously configured OpenClaw instance to your chosen cloud provider. It provisions the VPS, installs dependencies, configures OpenClaw, and sets up Tailscale (if enabled).

## Usage

```
/deploy
```

## Deployment Process

The deploy command follows these steps:

### 1. Select Deployment

Choose which configuration to deploy:

```
/deploy - Select a deployment to deploy

Use arrow keys to select, Enter to deploy:

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ > my-openclaw-server   [not_deployed]  hetzner │
│   production-instance  [deployed]      hetzner │
│   staging-test        [not_deployed]   digitalocean │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

<Note>
  Not-yet-deployed configurations appear first in the list for easy access.
</Note>

### 2. Confirmation

Review what will be deployed:

```
/deploy - Confirm deployment

Deploy "my-openclaw-server"?

This will:
• Create a VPS on hetzner
• Install and configure OpenClaw
• Set up Tailscale for secure access

Estimated cost: ~$4.99/month (Hetzner CPX11)

Press Y to confirm, N to cancel
```

### 3. Deployment Progress

Watch real-time progress:

```

## Deployment Steps

The deployment process includes these checkpoints:

1. **SSH Key Generation** - Creates a unique SSH key pair
2. **Key Upload** - Uploads public key to cloud provider
3. **Server Provisioning** - Creates the VPS instance
4. **Connection Wait** - Waits for SSH to become available
5. **System Updates** - Updates Ubuntu packages
6. **Node.js Installation** - Installs Node.js 20.x
7. **OpenClaw Installation** - Installs OpenClaw globally
8. **OpenClaw Configuration** - Sets up the agent configuration
9. **Service Setup** - Creates systemd service
10. **Tailscale Setup** (if enabled) - Configures VPN access
11. **Interactive Onboarding** - Opens terminal for setup

## Interactive Steps

### Tailscale Authentication

If Tailscale is enabled, you'll be prompted to authenticate:

```
Confirmation Required

Tailscale is starting. Please authenticate:

1. A browser window will open
2. Log in to your Tailscale account
3. Approve the machine

Ready to open browser?

Press Y for Yes, N for No
```

Press `Y` and a browser opens to the Tailscale login page.

### OpenClaw Onboarding

After initial setup, an interactive terminal opens:

```

## Resume Capability

Deployments are checkpoint-based. If a deployment fails, you can run `/deploy` again and it will resume from the last successful checkpoint.

```
Deployment Failed

Something went wrong during deployment.

Error: Connection timeout at checkpoint: install_openclaw

What you can do:
  1. Run /deploy again - it will resume from the last successful step
  2. Run /status to check the current state of your deployment
  3. Run /destroy and /new to start fresh if the issue persists

Press any key to return to home
```

## Success

When deployment completes:

```
Deployment Successful!

Your OpenClaw instance is now running.

## Example Terminal Session

```
> /deploy

/deploy - Select a deployment to deploy

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Tips

<Tip>
  Have your Tailscale credentials ready before deploying if you've enabled Tailscale. The deployment will pause to wait for authentication.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Deployments can take 5-10 minutes to complete. Don't close ClawControl during deployment - checkpoints allow safe resumption if interrupted.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Stuck

If deployment appears stuck:
1. Wait at least 2 minutes - some steps take time
2. Press Ctrl+C to cancel
3. Run `/status` to check current state
4. Run `/deploy` again to resume

### SSH Connection Failed

```
Error: Connection timeout at checkpoint: wait_for_ssh
```

- Cloud provider may be slow provisioning
- Firewall rules may be blocking SSH
- Run `/deploy` again to retry

### Tailscale Authentication Failed

```
Error: Tailscale authentication timeout
```

- You may have missed the browser authentication window
- Run `/deploy` again
- Choose "Yes" when prompted to open browser
- Complete authentication within 5 minutes
