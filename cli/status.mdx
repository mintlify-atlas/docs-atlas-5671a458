The `/status` command displays detailed information about all your deployments, including connection details, health checks, and deployment history.

## Usage

```
/status
```

## Status Display

View all deployments with their current states:

```
/status - Deployment Status

Deployments (3)
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ > production-claude    [deployed]          │
│   staging-test        [deployed]           │
│   dev-instance        [not_deployed]       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Deployment Details

Select a deployment to view comprehensive details:

```
Details: production-claude

Status:         deployed
Provider:       hetzner
Server IP:      203.0.113.45
Tailscale IP:   100.64.0.12
Created:        2/28/2026, 10:30:15 AM
Deployed:       2/28/2026, 10:42:33 AM
```

## Health Checks

Press Enter on a selected deployment to run health checks:

```
Details: production-claude

Status:         deployed
Provider:       hetzner
Server IP:      203.0.113.45
Tailscale IP:   100.64.0.12

Health Check:
SSH:            Connected
OpenClaw:       Running
Last checked:   2:45:30 PM

Checkpoints: 12 completed

Up/Down: Select | Enter: Health check | Esc: Back
```

### Health Check Results

- **SSH: Connected** - Server is reachable via SSH
- **SSH: Unreachable** - Cannot connect (server may be down)
- **OpenClaw: Running** - Service is active and running
- **OpenClaw: Not running** - Service is stopped or crashed

## Deployment States

Possible deployment states:

- `not_deployed` - Configuration created but not deployed
- `deploying` - Currently being deployed
- `deployed` - Successfully deployed and running
- `failed` - Deployment failed (shows last error)

## Checkpoints

Each deployment tracks completed checkpoints:

```
Checkpoints: 12 completed
```

Checkpoints allow resuming failed deployments from the last successful step.

## Error Display

If a deployment has errors:

```
Details: staging-test

Status:         failed
Provider:       digitalocean
Server IP:      Not deployed
Last Error:     Connection timeout at checkpoint: wait_for_ssh
```

- **Esc** - Return to home

## Empty State

If no deployments exist:

```
/status - Deployment Status

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ No deployments found!                      │
│ Run /new to create a deployment.           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Press any key to return to home
```

## Use Cases

### Quick Health Check

1. Run `/status`
2. Press Enter on a deployment
3. Wait for health check results

### Monitor Multiple Deployments

1. Run `/status`
2. Use arrow keys to navigate between deployments
3. Press Enter to check health of each
4. Compare results

### Troubleshooting

1. Run `/status`
2. Check "Last Error" field for failed deployments
3. Note the checkpoint where failure occurred
4. Run `/deploy` to resume from that checkpoint

## Integration with Other Commands

### After Deployment

```bash
# Deploy
> /deploy
# [Deployment completes]

# Check status
> /status
# Verify deployment is marked as 'deployed'
# Run health check to confirm services are running
```

### Before Destroying

```bash
# Check what's deployed
> /status

# Note server IP and Tailscale IP
# Verify you're destroying the correct deployment

> /destroy
```

## Tips

<Tip>
  Run periodic health checks to ensure your OpenClaw instances are healthy. The health check validates both SSH connectivity and OpenClaw service status.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Health checks connect to your server over SSH. This may take a few seconds depending on network latency and server load.
