---

ClawControl is an interactive TUI (Text User Interface) tool that simplifies deploying and managing OpenClaw instances on cloud providers. It handles all the complex setup including VPS provisioning, Node.js installation, OpenClaw configuration, and Tailscale VPN setup.

## Installation

Install ClawControl globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g clawcontrol
```

## Basic Usage

Launch the interactive TUI:

```bash
clawcontrol
```

The TUI provides a command-based interface where you type commands like `/new`, `/deploy`, `/status`, etc.

## Command Structure

All commands start with a forward slash (`/`) followed by the command name:

```
/new        # Initialize a new deployment
/deploy     # Deploy a configuration
/status     # Check deployment status
/ssh        # Connect to a server
/logs       # View logs
/dashboard  # Open web dashboard
/destroy    # Delete a deployment
```

## Interactive Features

- **Command autocompletion**: Type `/` and start typing to see suggestions
- **Arrow key navigation**: Use up/down arrows to navigate through options
- **Tab completion**: Press Tab to autocomplete commands from suggestions
- **Help system**: Type `/help` for a complete command reference

## Quick Start Workflow

1. **Create a deployment configuration**
   ```
   /new
   ```

2. **Deploy to the cloud**
   ```
   /deploy
   ```

3. **Monitor your deployment**
   ```
   /status
   ```

4. **Connect via SSH**
   ```
   /ssh
   ```

## Supported Cloud Providers

- **Hetzner Cloud** - Recommended (~$4.99/month for CPX11)
- **DigitalOcean** - Starting at $12/month

## Configuration Storage

ClawControl stores all deployment configurations in:

```
~/.clawcontrol/deployments/
```

Each deployment has its own directory containing:
- Configuration files (`.json`)
- SSH keys (`.pem`)
- State information
