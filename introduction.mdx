title: Introduction to ClawControl
description: Deploy and manage OpenClaw instances on VPS providers with an intuitive CLI/TUI
---

ClawControl is a CLI/TUI that deploys and manages OpenClaw on VPS providers. It guides you through provisioning, installs dependencies, configures OpenClaw, and secures access with Tailscale.

<Note>
ClawControl makes OpenClaw setup repeatable and fast. It handles VPS provisioning, SSH setup, Node and pnpm installs, OpenClaw configuration, and Tailscale onboarding so you can focus on running your agent.
</Note>

## What is ClawControl?

ClawControl is an interactive terminal application built with React and OpenTUI that orchestrates the complete deployment workflow for OpenClaw instances. Instead of manually configuring servers, installing dependencies, and setting up networking, ClawControl automates the entire process through a command palette interface.

## How it works

ClawControl follows a checkpoint-based deployment workflow:

1. **Initialize configuration** - Define your deployment with `/new`, selecting cloud provider, AI model, and communication channels
2. **Deploy to VPS** - Run `/deploy` to automatically provision infrastructure and install all dependencies
3. **Monitor status** - Use `/status` to check deployment health and OpenClaw daemon status
4. **Manage deployments** - Access logs, SSH directly, or destroy resources when needed

The deployment process uses 15 checkpoints with automatic retry logic:

- Server creation and SSH key upload
- SSH connection and swap configuration  
- System updates and dependency installation (NVM, Node, pnpm, Chrome)
- OpenClaw installation and configuration
- Tailscale setup for secure access
- Systemd daemon startup

If any step fails, ClawControl automatically retries up to 3 times before asking if you want to restart from the beginning.

## Command palette

ClawControl uses a slash-command interface inspired by modern chat applications:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Initialize a new deployment |
| `/list` | List, edit, or fork deployments |
| `/deploy` | Deploy an initialized configuration |
| `/status` | View deployment status |
| `/ssh` | SSH into a deployment |
| `/logs` | View deployment logs |
| `/dashboard` | Open OpenClaw dashboard in browser |
| `/destroy` | Destroy a deployment |
| `/channels` | View configured channels |
| `/templates` | Manage deployment templates |
| `/help` | Show help |

## Supported providers

## AI provider support

ClawControl configures OpenClaw to work with multiple AI providers:

- **Anthropic** - Claude models (claude-sonnet-4, claude-3-5-haiku)
- **OpenAI** - GPT models (gpt-4o, o1-preview)
- **OpenRouter** - Multi-provider access
- **Google** - Gemini models (gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-1.5-pro)
- **Groq** - Fast inference (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
